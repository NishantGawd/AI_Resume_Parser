# AI_Resume_Parser
This project is an AI-powered Resume Parser App developed as part of my internship at Pinnacle Labs.  The app automatically extracts key details (such as name, email, phone number, education, skills, and experience) from PDF and DOCX resumes and outputs the information in a structured, machine-readable format (e.g., JSON or Excel).
